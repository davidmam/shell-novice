<h1> Specific notes about the Dundee setup</h1>

Every IT installation is different and Dundee is no exception. We are using a Windows based computer with Git-bash installed. 
Read the following notes carefully in order to get it all to behave.

<h2> Your home directory</h2>
All users in Dundee have a home directory which is mounted as drive <b>H:\</b>. No matter which computer you log in to, 
this drive will always be mounted there. In many of the tutorials there will be references to a home directory 
being <code>/Users/fredbloggs</code>, (Mac) <code>C:\Users\fredbloggs</code> (Windows), or <code>/usr/fredbloggs</code> (Linux)
where <i>fredbloggs</i> 
is the users username. On the Dundee computers it is <code>H:\</i>. If you are using your own computer then it may be one 
of the other options, or something completely different. A helper can advise you.

<h2> Finding and starting Git-Bash </h2>
<i>Git-Bash</i> has only just been deployed to the desktop and may not appear in the Windows menu.

<h3>Easy Route<h3>

    Click on the Windows button, then select `All Programs`, `School Software`, `Life Sciences`, `General` and a *Git-Bash* icon should be there.

<h3>Alternative Route to install Git-Bash<h3>
<ol>
<li> Click on the Windows button, select 'Documents' from the list on the right side of the popup to open a file explorer window.</li>
<li>  Click in the file explorer location bar and set the location to <i>\\dundee\media\apps\Other\Git\GitforWindows\Installer</i></li>
<li>  Click `Install`. This will (after a short while) run a terminal window which takes some time to complete. It is a good job to do this as soon as you log in the first time.</li>
<li> Click on the Windows button, then `All Programs` and `Update Shortcuts`. </li>
<li> Follow the <b>Easy Route</b> above.</li>


<h2>Text Editors</h2>
We do not have any editors installed except <b>vi</b> which is arcane, powerful, very cranky and not novice friendly. So we'll ignore that 
though you may see an instructor using it to do a quick edit. Instead we will be using <b>Notepad++</b>. This can be found by clicking on the Windows button, then `All Programs`, `Utilities and Accessories`. You will then find the `Notepad++` icon.

<h3> Configuring Git to use Notepad++</h3>
At a Git-Bash prompt type
<code>git config --global core.editor "'C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"</code>
This will now launch Notepad++ whenever Git requires an editor.
